  navigator and cartographer. Cook was the first Captain to find a cure for scurvy
  by feeding his crew limes that gave them the yet to be discovered vitamin C. Cook
  also mapped much of the American west coast from Oregon up to Alaska. He discovered
  New Zealand and Australia''s Great Barrier Reef on which he crashed his ship."--Advertisement.'
